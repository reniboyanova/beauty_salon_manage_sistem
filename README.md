Beauty Management System (BMSystem) is a project that can provide solutions for all the beauty types of business
- like hairdressers - salons; cosmetic studios, make-up artists, etc.
- It can be personalized by the business needs.
- In this project example I do it for a hairdresser salon.
- The BMSystem is open for use by owners and their employees, not for customers.
- System has a database which is provides storing all the information about procedures, and client profiles - type hair, hair color, hair length, skin type, and else.
- To use the system it needs to make a registration for the owner (make it a superuser from the admin site), and the employees.
- There can be different permission groups. In this example - two group types - 'Managers' and 'Staff group' (Excluding superuser);
- There is an option to have a product side, which means you can have a collection with products that your Beauty business use. This is an easy way to inform your employees and connect the products with procedures
